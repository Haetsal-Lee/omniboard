# Usage

## Metric Columns

New metric columns can be added to display rolled up metric value (e.g., minimum validation loss, maximum training accuracy, etc.)
To be able to add a metric column, your experiments should track at-least one metric value. 
Check out [sacred documentation](https://sacred.readthedocs.io/en/latest/collected_information.html#metrics-api) for more info.

To add a new metric column, click on `+/- Metric Columns` button located on top right 
of Omniboard dashboard and fill out the details in the modal dialog that pops up.
